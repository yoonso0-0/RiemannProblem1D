# Riemann Problem 1D
> with [SpECTRE](https://github.com/sxs-collaboration/spectre) code.


## How to build executables

In the SpECTRE build directory, run
```
make EvolveNewtonianEulerRiemannProblem1D
```
to build an executable.

## Rendering
Output of the code can be visualized with `render1D.py` 

which is a copy of `Render1D.py` script in `src/Visualization/Python/` directory of SpECTRE source.
